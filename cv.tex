\section{Work Experience}
\subsection{}
\textbf{OptoFidelity Oy. (Imaging Engineer),} October 2017 -
\begin{itemize}[label={--}]
  \itemsep0em 

  \item Worked on machine vision problems related to testing Head Mounted
    Displays.  This includes writing camera drivers, performing camera
    calibrations, designing camera alignment algorithms for Head Mounted
    Displays, designing and implementing algorithms for different analyses and
    implementing standard measurement methods e.g, IEC 63145-20-10

  \item Worked for undisclosed client (Internal name: Sauna). This project
    involved porting and optimizing production ready image analysis algorithms,
    which was in MATLAB, to Objective-C. Delivered project onsite.

  \item Worked for undisclosed client (Internal name: Sauna). This project
    involved developing an IQC (Internal Quality Control) tester for clients
    various different internal components.  Delivered project onsite.

  \item Worked on various projects related to software and imaging alogirthms
    for display test automation.

\end{itemize}
